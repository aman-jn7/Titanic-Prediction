# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using Logistic Regression. It focuses on basic data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, with a clean and structured approach to applying machine learning on tabular data.

## 🎯 Task Objectives

- Handle and clean real-world missing data
- Encode categorical features for model input
- Apply logistic regression for binary classification
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualize evaluation metrics using a heatmap
