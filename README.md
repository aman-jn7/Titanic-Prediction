# üö¢ Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using Logistic Regression. It focuses on basic data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, with a clean and structured approach to applying machine learning on tabular data.

## üéØ Task Objectives

- Handle and clean real-world missing data
- Encode categorical features for model input
- Apply logistic regression for binary classification
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualize evaluation metrics using a heatmap

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aman-jn7/Titanic-Prediction.git
cd Titanic-Prediction

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
